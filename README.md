# BugTracker API

REST API for a Bug Tracker application that I am developing as a side project. Front-end of the application will be done in Angular but it is still currently in development. The app will have the ability to create a project and assign developers to the project. All users will be able to add tickets which they can mark as bugs, features and enhancements. Developers can be assigned to work on each ticket.

* REST API is developed using Spring Boot.
* It uses PostgreSQL 
* Authentication and authorization are implemented using Spring Security and JWT
